##  About the Project

This project provides a web-based tool for predicting future COVID-19 case numbers.

- **Input**: Date (e.g., `2025-06-01`)
- **Output**: Predicted number of COVID-19 cases

The model is trained on historical case data and uses polynomial regression to fit the curve and forecast future values.
