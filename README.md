COVID-19 Prediction using Polynomial Regression
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts the number of COVID-19 cases based on a given date using Polynomial Regression.

🔍 About the Project
Input: Date (e.g., 2025-06-01)

Output: Predicted number of COVID-19 patients

This model uses Polynomial Regression to fit past case data and forecast future values.

Built using Python and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.
